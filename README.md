**How It Works**
Tech Trends seamlessly combines data scraping, skill analysis, and website development to provide you with a comprehensive view of the job market in Pakistan. Here's how our new features are integrated into the system:

**1. Data Scraping Using Scraping Bee's SDK (Python)**

Data from LinkedIn job postings in Pakistan is collected using APIMATIC's Scrapping Bee SDK, while it is meticulously categorized by city, seniority level, and posting month, ensuring that our platform delivers specific and timely insights.

**2. Skill Analysis with OpenAI API**

The job descriptions collected are sent to the OpenAI API for skill analysis, which is then used to create detailed insights into skill requirements for each job posting.

**3. Web Development with EJS and Node.js**

Our user-friendly website, built with EJS and Node.js, includes dedicated sections to view insights city-wise, skill-wise, seniority level-wise, and month-wise job postings, making it easier for you to access the information you need.

4. Data Visualization Using Image Charts API

Image Charts API is employed to create visually appealing and informative charts. These charts break down job market trends by city, skill, seniority level, and posting month, allowing for intuitive data visualization. Due to the unknown response format of Charts SDK on APIMATIC's website for TypeScript, the SDK is not used.
